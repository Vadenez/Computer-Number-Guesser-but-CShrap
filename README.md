# Computer-Number-Guesser-but-CShrap
Coded in C#

This is a game where your computer will try and guess your value. Same thing as a program that
I had created in C++, but in C#. You give the console a maximum and minimum value, then you give
it the attual value it has to guess (which would be inbetween the min and max). You then give
the computer an amount of seconds, between each guess it will give, then the guessing begins.
The only input the computer gets back is if it got the number correct or not, and if its higher
or lower. From this the program guesses untill it gets it right.

This was coded in 2021
